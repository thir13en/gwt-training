# GWT Training

Time to do some frontend archeology ðŸ‘·

You can find out more on GWT on the [official website](http://www.gwtproject.org/).  

I am also gathering some notes in the learing process, they are available [here](notes/index.md).


### Overview
`GWT` stands for `Google Web Toolkit`, it is basically a pre-historic Java framework that compiles to native JavaScript.  
It is open source, completely free, and possibly discontinued and totally legacy.
