# General


### What’s inside the toolbox?

#### SDK
The GWT SDK contains the Java API libraries, compiler, and development server. It lets you write client-side applications in Java and deploy them as JavaScript.

### Developing with GWT
The `GWT SDK` provides a set of core `Java APIs` and `Widgets` (equivalent to modern framework `componets`). These allow you to write `AJAX` applications in `Java` and then compile the source to highly optimized `JavaScript` that runs across all browsers.

### Debug
Thanks to the `GWT developer plugin`, there’s no compiling of code to `JavaScript` to view it in the browser. You can use the same edit-refresh-view cycle you’re used to with `JavaScript`, while at the same time inspect variables, set breakpoints, and utilize all the other debugger tools available to you with `Java`. And because `GWT’s` development mode is now in the browser itself, you can use tools like Firebug and Inspector as you code in Java.
